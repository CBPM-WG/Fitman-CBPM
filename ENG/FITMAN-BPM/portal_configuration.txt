The fitman bpm service provide the following services:

	- Asset Management Service
	- SSO Management Service (HTTPS)

The integration these services is possible by configuring a certificate 
properly configured IP address assigned to the machine.


Certificate configuration
=====================================================================
To generate the certificate, refer to the following guide: 
( http://www.mkyong.com/webservices/jax-ws/suncertpathbuilderexception-unable-to-find-valid-certification-path-to-requested-target/)
or (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19146-01/821-0793/gdhfz/index.html).

At the end of the configuration, re-start of the server.


Portal startup
=====================================================================
Follow the instructions below to start and stop the service:

start services (commands described are to be executed in a terminal):

  	fitmanportal - cd /opt/fitman_portal/tomacat-7.0.27/bin 
				 - sudo ./startup.sh
 	
 	sso 		 - /etc/init.d/sso start


stop services: 

	fitmanportal - cd /opt/fitman_portal/tomacat-7.0.27/bin 
				 - sudo ./shutdown.sh
	
	sso 		 - /etc/init.d/sso stop

the password to perform super user operations (sudo command) is "fitman"


Portal Configuration
=====================================================================
The environment is already set up to run from inside the virtual machine in order to configure the platform properly please follow the steps as described.

Definition: all urls are configured as "localhost", this allows the platform to work from inside the virtual machine, the following configuration assumes that the user wants to configure it to work from outside, so we will change "localhost" with the virtual machine public IP, it can be retrieved typing ifconfig in a terminal inside the vm.

Pease use the public IP for the the configuration described below

First start the portal server.

SSO:
	
	When first launched the SSO system is not enabled (also from inside the virtual machine), to configure it follow these steps:
	
	a. Navigate to the portal (example http://localhost).
	
	b. Use the following credentials to login to the portal: Username -> admin Password -> 54321qwerty
	
	c. Go to Control Panel and select the Portal Setting
	
	d. Select the Autentication Section and the CAS Server Configuration
	
	e. Check Enabled.
	
	f. Enter the following parameter:
		
		(Please note that the final configuration for this parameters will look like it is currently set, but with public IP, retrieved before, replacing "localhost")
		
		1. Login URL 
		(Set the CAS server login URL. Users will be redirected to the CAS login page when authenticating into the portal)
		
		2. Logout URL
		(Set the CAS server logout URL. Set this if you want the portal's logout function to trigger a CAS logout.)
		
		3. Server Name
		(Set this to enable deep linking into the portal (e.g. http://localhost:8080). Do not set this if the CAS service URL is set.)
		
		4. Server URL
		(Set the CAS server domain URL.)
		
		5. Service URL
		(Set this to disable deep linking into the portal (e.g. http://localhost:8080/c/portal/login). Do not set this if the CAS server name is set.)
		
		6. No Such User Redirect URL
		(Set the URL to redirect a user to, if the user can authenticate with CAS but cannot be found in the portal. If import from LDAP is enabled, then the user will be redirected if he cannot be found or could not be imported from LDAP.)
 
	g. Save the configuration.


COMPEL:
	- Logged in as administrator (Admin), navigate to the compel tab and click on the small settings icon on top right corner and change the 	  url replacing localhost with the server public IP.


	- Inside the virtual machine go to /opt/fitman_portal/tomcat-7-0-27/webapps/ActivitiCompelExplorer2/WEB-INF and edit SSO url for properties 
	  casServerLoginUrl, casServerUrlPrefix and serverName inside web.xml as described above.
	  also set the property redirectAfterValidation to false

	  (a guide is available at the following link: https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/Configuring+the+Jasig+CAS+Client+for+Java+in+the+web.xml)

	- Inside the virtual machine go to /opt/fitman_portal/tomcat-7-0-27/webapps/ActivitiCompelExplorer2/WEB-INF/lib/ open EngActivitiPlugin and 
	  edit the file cas-plugin.properties changing the property SSOHostname and replacing localhost with server public IP


The server needs to be restarted after this configuration.
