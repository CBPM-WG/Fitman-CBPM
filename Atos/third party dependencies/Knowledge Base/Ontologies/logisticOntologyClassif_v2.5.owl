    <rdfs:comment>Version 2.5 - December  2012 

List of changes compared to the previous version 2.4:

1. Activity class:
    - decomposition of activities in atomic and complex activities;
    - introduction of the ActivityType class to denote different types of activities

2. Introduction of the Event class 

3. Actor class:
    - The Actor class of version 2.4 is now called Party
    - The Shipper class (under the class Party) is now called Consignor

4. Introduction of the Entity class:
    - The Resource class of version 2.4 is now incorporated in the Entity class and it is now refined in Moveable Resource and Static Resource 
   - The ModeofTransport of version 2.4 is now called TrasnportMode and it is incorporated in the Entity class as an IntangibleEntity
    
5. Location class:
    - it is now decomposed in GeoArea and GeoPoint in order to denote coarse-grained location and fine-grained location. 
    - the Location class of version 2.4, which was decomposed in Port and Terminal, now it is called Facility and it is a type of StaticResource (under the Entity class) </rdfs:comment>

We have identified some relevant activity types, but the list is not complete and can be further extended. 

The identified activity types are the following:
- Transport, which denotes the activity of moving load units (namely, products and/or packages and/or pieces of equipment, but also empty containers) from a location of origin to a location of destination, in a certain time, using suitable transport mode and transport means;
- Transhipment, which denotes the activity of changing transport mode at an intermediate destination and, consequently, transshipment implies a change of transport means (for example, from a truck to a vessel in a port);
- Loading,  which denotes the activity of placing load units (namely, products and/or packages and/or pieces of equipment, but also empty containers) into/onto a transport means prior to transportation;
- Unloading, which denotes the activity of taking out load units (or other piece of equipment) (namely, products and/or packages and/or pieces of equipment, but also empty containers) from a transport means after transportation;
- Storage, which denotes the activity of keeping in stock products, and/or packages, and/or pieces of equipment, but also empty containers, in a warehouse facility for a certain period of time;
- Consolidation, which denotes the activity of assembling of several (small) load units into one (big) unit;
- Deconsolidation, which denotes the activity of disassembling of one (big) load unit in several (small) units.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Activity">
    <rdfs:comment>An activity denotes some action continuous in time that is relevant for the purpose of logistics.

An Activity has an ActivityType (such as, for example, Transport, Transhipment, Storage, etc.)

Some activities are atomic and can be used to compose more complex activities. An example of complex activity is the following:
1) Loading a certain transport means with a container in a location of origin
2) Transport of the container using the transport means towards a location of destination
3) Unloading the transport means at the location of destination

Activities can be combined with events. For example, consider the following sequence : 
1) the activity of loading a container on a truck and the departure event of the truck;
2) the road transport activity and the arrival event of the truck at a certain port; 
3) the transshipment of the container from the truck to a vessel, which implies that an arrival event of the vessel has previously taken place; 
4) the departure event of the vessel and the sea transport activity of the container; 
5) the arrival event of the vessel in a port of destination;  
6) the transshipment of the container from the vessel to a truck, which implies that an arrival event of the truck has previously taken place; 
7) the departure event of the truck and the road transport activity towards a destination location; and 
8) the arrival event of the truck and the activity of unloading the container from the truck.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Event">
    <rdfs:comment>An event is an occurrence of interest for the execution of a certain activity.

In contrast to an activity, which denotes an action that is continous in time, an event denotes an occurrence at a specific moment in time. Events trigger the execution of activities.

For example, the departure of a transport means from a location of origin and its arrival to the destination can be regarded, respectively, as start and end events for the transport activity

Events can be combined with activities. For example, consider the following sequence : 
1) the activity of loading a container on a truck and the departure event of the truck;
2) the road transport activity and the arrival event of the truck at a certain port; 
3) the transshipment of the container from the truck to a vessel, which implies that an arrival event of the vessel has previously taken place; 
4) the departure event of the vessel and the sea transport activity of the container; 
5) the arrival event of the vessel in a port of destination;  
6) the transshipment of the container from the vessel to a truck, which implies that an arrival event of the truck has previously taken place; 
7) the departure event of the truck and the road transport activity towards a destination location; and

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Location">
    <rdfs:comment>The geo location represents the geographical area or geographical point used to define the place of origin and destination for entities and activities. 

Location can have different levels of granularity. Location can be coarse-grained for scheduling, since in long term planning it is sufficient to specify approximately the place of origin and destination, such as, for example, the Netherlands or the port of Rotterdam. However, location needs to be fine-grained for delivery, since one has to specify the precise address to which a certain item must be delivered.

Since location is a concept common to other domains, we probably do not need to define it from scratch, but we can import another existing ontology (if there are any). </rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Transshipment">
    <rdfs:comment>Transshipment is the activity of changing transport mode at an intermediate destination and, consequently, transshipment implies a change of transport means (for example, from a truck to a vessel in a port). 

Therefore, transshipment can be defined as a complex activity that takes place at an intermediate destination and consists of:
1) Unloading a load unit from a transport means;
2) Storage (optional);
3) Loading to another transport means;
afterwards, the transshipment is followed by the actual transport towards the final destination (maybe through other intermediate locations).

Sometimes transshipment is realized for the purpose of consolidation and this activity is called "cross-docking". In this case, we have a complex activity of transhipment that involves:
1) Unloading; 
2) Deconsolidation;
3) Storage (optional);
4) Consolidation; 
5) Loading;
afterwards, the transshipment is followed by the actual transport towards the final destination (maybe through other intermediate locations).</rdfs:comment>
